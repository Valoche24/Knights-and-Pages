            <h2>What is problem to solve?</h2>

            <p> Many years ago, three knights waited to cross the river neva.Each knight had his own page, so there were six people.</p>

            <p>The boat that they had could only carry two.<br>
              However the knights were ferocious killers
              and the three pages were terrified. <br> In fact, it was certain that any of the pages would die
              of heart failure if he were not protected at every instant from the other knights by the presence of his own master.</p>

            <p>Was there any way to cross everyone
                over the river <br> without losing a page ?</p>

            <div class="numbertext">2/3</div>
